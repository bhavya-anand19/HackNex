          Do I Need Counseling or Psychotherapy?
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Counseling and psychotherapy are two types of mental health treatments
          that can really help people dealing with emotional and psychological
          issues. However, it can be tough to decide which one is right for you.
          Here’s a simple guide to help you understand the difference and figure
          out what you might need.

          What’s the Difference Between Counseling and Psychotherapy?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Counseling:</strong> This usually involves shorter sessions
          and focuses on specific problems. For example, it might help you cope
          with a recent loss or improve a relationship issue.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> This is a longer-term treatment that
          looks deeper into your life and helps you understand underlying
          issues. It often addresses patterns in your thoughts and behaviors
          that may be affecting your life.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Making the Decision</h2>

          Choosing between counseling and psychotherapy is a personal decision
          Think about your own needs:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            Counseling might be better if you want a focused, short-term
            solution for a specific issue.

        </ul>
